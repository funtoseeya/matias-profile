                    <p>
                        I love YouTube, but it doesn’t love me back. Endless feeds, adds, and Shorts viewing style steal hours I
                        could spend on things that matter. So I built my own version.

                    I kept finding myself trapped in the scroll, clicking on videos I didn’t really care about, losing
                    hours, and leaving frustrated. YouTube’s algorithms aren’t built to help me. They’re built to keep me
                    hooked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I stripped it down. My version, Detube, is just search and watch. No feeds. No Shorts. No manipulative
                    recommendations. Just me and the videos I actually came to see. Finally, a YouTube that respects my time
                    and attention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The work is complete. I've built a minimal YouTube interface that lets me search and watch videos
                    without ads, algorithmic feeds, or the other things that make YouTube a time sink.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    I built it using Python for the backend to interact with YouTube's API, and vanilla JavaScript for
                    the frontend to handle user interactions. Bootstrap is used for styling to keep things clean and
                    simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used this as a project to learn how to work with APIs and backends. Previously I only worked with
                    client-side applications. The tech is quite simple: Python queries YouTube's API and passes the search query,
                    sorting preferences, and whether Shorts should be included. Vanilla JS handles the search, sorting,
                    refresh, and rendering, while Bootstrap keeps everything styled neatly.
