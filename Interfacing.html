                <h4>Process Automation</h4>
                <h5>Replacing paper with software</h5>

                <p> One of the most fascinating parts of our work at Interfacing Technologies was helping Fortune 500
                    companies automate complex business processes. Picture an enterprise managing spreadsheets,
                    documents, KPIs, and data from multiple places. Our challenge? Simplify and unify it all. </p>
                <p> We built software that centralized operations into one system, powered by a single database. This
                    made reporting, data management, and automated communication seamless, while giving full visibility
                    across departments. </p>
                <p> Our solutions spanned engineering, maintenance, business, and legal teams. Designing systems that
                    handled e-forms, notifications, and real-time reports was both rewarding and impactful, knowing they
                    kept critical processes running smoothly. </p>
                <p> My academic background in supply chain management and tech analysis blended perfectly with this
                    role. Previous experience taught me to improve workflows before automating, echoing Bill Gates'
                    sentiment that automation magnifies inefficiency. </p>
                <p> I wore many hats: business analyst, development lead, and even data migration specialist.
                    Transforming and integrating data from multiple sources into our software was challenging but
                    leveled up my SQL skills, making every project an opportunity to grow. </p>

                <p> Our consulting work took me around the globe, collaborating with Fortune
                    500 companies to refine their business processes. Unlike our software-focused projects, this work
                    centered purely on traditional business process management. We led extensive workshops with
                    stakeholders, mapping out workflows, identifying risks, inefficiencies, KPIs, and the systems in
                    play. From there, we helped redesign and optimize processes, applying methods akin to Six Sigma,
                    emphasizing efficiency and measurable improvements. </p>
                <p> It was an experience unlike any other for a young consultant. At twenty-five to twenty-eight years
                    old, I found myself in the room with seasoned professionals, leading high-stakes discussions. The
                    work demanded a blend of confidence, knowledge, and adaptability, especially when working thousands
                    of kilometers from home. I had to quickly master disciplines like risk management, performance, and
                    data governance while speaking the language of various business functions. </p>
                <p> The job's global nature was unique. Unlike typical consulting firms that often operate within
                    specific regions, our work was international. My assignments took me to places like Gabon, South
                    America, and Oceania. Before heading to some locations, like the deep jungles of Gabon for a major
                    mining client, I had to get vaccinations for yellow fever and typhoid—an adventure in itself. My
                    ability to speak French and Spanish opened doors to projects that many consultants never get to
                    experience, giving me an even broader perspective. </p>
                <p> Each project was a crash course in a different industry. I absorbed knowledge about mining
                    operations, manufacturing intricacies, logistics challenges, and utility management. In Oregon, for
                    example, I worked with a power utility, gaining an understanding of collaborative processes between
                    data centers and power plants. Listening to experts explain the mechanics of their world was a
                    masterclass in real-world business operations, one that has left a lasting impact on me. </p>

                <h4>Building the Reporting Suite</h4>
                <h5>How we quadrupled product usage with BI</h5>
                <img src="./assets/itc-report-scorecard.PNG" class="blog-body-img">

                <p>Early in my career, I embarked on an unexpected journey into business intelligence (BI) at
                    Interfacing Technologies. As a junior analyst learning SQL, I found myself navigating the company’s
                    complex, object-based repository, where interconnected elements like processes, risks, and KPIs
                    formed a rich web of data relationships. This structure was intimidating yet full of potential for
                    generating deep client insights.</p>
                <p>Clients often struggled with the software’s rigid, outdated reporting capabilities, so I took on the
                    challenge of designing a full BI suite from scratch. Immersing myself in SQL and the database
                    architecture, I created nearly 100 tailored reports. For risk management, I built a visual heat map
                    and a comprehensive risk register. For performance management, I developed dashboards linking KPIs
                    to strategic outcomes, helping clients see how each part of their business was performing.</p>
                <p>This technical experience was transformative. I mastered SQL, refined my analytical thinking, and
                    turned raw data into actionable insights. The impact was clear: product usage increased fourfold as
                    clients embraced these new reports. They were motivated to engage with data in ways that made better
                    operational sense, empowering their decision-making and driving performance.</p>

                <h4>A One-Person Product Army</h4>
                <h5>How a world-class management system kicked off my career in product</h5>
                <img src="./assets/itc-screen-map.webp" class="blog-body-img">
                <img src="./assets/itc-screenshots-networks.png" class="blog-body-img">

                <p>When I joined Interfacing, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. We made the company’s flagship product, the
                    Enterprise Process Center (EPC), into a powerhouse of functionality. We built in the ability to model
                    processes,
                    analyze risks, generate standard operating procedures, identify roles and responsibilities,
                    monitor KPIs, map data flows, identify network dependencies, and so much more.</p>



                <p>This kind of functionality was needed for ops, quality and compliance, and risk management teams.
                     It offered governance features like approval workflows and audit logs, ensuring strict adherence to regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The demands of the role extended far beyond typical product management.
                     I created marketing content, trained users, led product demos, answered countless RFPs,
                     took on customer support calls, developed sales decks, led implementions and even oversaw
                    change management. Engaging with our user community, I organized webinars and built relationships with
                    power users, fostering a loyal customer base. 
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>Even though I was junior in title, I shouldered
                    responsibilities that today would be divided among specialized teams. The exposure was invaluable,
                    and it gave me a deep appreciation for balancing complexity and usability, preparing me for any
                    product challenge I would face in the future.</p>
