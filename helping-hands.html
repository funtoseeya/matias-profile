                    <p>I've recently started lending a hand at the Squamish Helping Hands Society and have noticed a few
                        things.

                <h4>First month in</h4>
                <h5>More than just serving supper</h5>

                <p> A month into helping serve supper at the local homeless shelter, I’ve come to realize just how much
                    of a privilege it is to lend a hand. My wife has always given back in different ways, and she’s an
                    inspiration to me to be a better person. Her example motivated me to start helping out too. It’s
                    only two hours a week—really not much—but it’s something, and it feels like it matters. </p>
                <p> I mentioned in the Flipper’s Fury blog that I love food and serving it, and this is an extension of
                    that. My first job was in a restaurant, and though it was stressful, that’s where I discovered a
                    huge part of myself. I love serving people, seeing them smile, and being part of their experience
                    around food. It’s a feeling I still crave, so volunteering here feels like a natural fit. It’s also
                    a little like my quest to learn how to code. As a product manager, I’m always watching the
                    developers
                    build the product just like how, in restaurants, I was always serving, not making the food.
                    Volunteering here lets me
                    get a little closer to the ‘building’ side of things. Funny how when you write things down, the
                    connections start to make sense. My career has always been with the customer - I love that AND I
                    also want to contribute to how the sausage is made, so to speak. </p>
                <p> In the few times I’ve volunteered, I’ve been filled with joy. I’ve helped in a number of ways in the
                    kitchen, but what really stands out is interacting with the people in line. These are people who
                    have stumbled on hard times. Society often labels them as the “lowest class,” but in reality, they
                    are just like us. I love cracking jokes and seeing them smile. Some are having bad days, others are
                    weaning off a high, and some seem fine outwardly, but are likely struggling in ways we can’t see.
                    What I find inspiring, though, is the sense of community they have. Despite all the differences,
                    they coexist—supporting each other, and often finding a bit of joy in the midst of hardship.
                    Volunteering here has truly humanized them in ways that go beyond just serving a meal. </p>
