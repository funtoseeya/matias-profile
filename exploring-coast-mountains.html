                <p>
                    We start our adventure on an early November morning. Alarm at 5AM. Coffee. Soup in Thermos. Make sure I've
                    got what I need. Go.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We make it to the Rubble Creek trail head at 7AM. We set up our skis as A-frames on our backpacks
                    and get going. There isn't any snow for at least another 1000m.
                    We walk for about 2 hours along what seems to be 100 switchbacks until we hit
                    the Garibaldi Lake / Taylor Meadows turn off. Finally a bit of snow! We keep on walking until we
                    get to the warming hut just past Taylor Meadows campground.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skins on. Feeling a little rusty, but I get them on. Finally, I can get the awkward weight of skis
                    and boots
                    off my back. So we walk until about 1600m, at which there's a turn off to the Black Tusk trail. We
                    take that and are joined by two other crews of eager beavers.
                    We gladly let them take the lead - that means we don't need to break trail. Yay!
                </p>
                <p> We climb up to about 1900m and wow - what incredible views of Garibaldi lake and the surroundings! 
                    This place is so majical, especially with a little coat of snow.
                    And there lies our problem - we only manage to 
                    probe about 30-60cm, which is far too little for what we need. We're on a boulder field.
                    That means sharks, core shots, and even injury. After eating lunch
                    and a cold beer, we decide to survival ski back to the trail, sheepish and with our
                    tails between our legs.
                </p>
                <p>Once we reach the trail, luckily, there's a fairly steady
                    decending grade until snowline, so we can ski down the trail all the way back to the warming hut.
                    The rest is just a long boring walk back the way we came through the infinite switchbacks. 
                    We are blessed with many types of mushrooms to contemplate along the way down.
                    We make it back to the car, drink a beer, and agree that we'll ride bikes next week-end.
