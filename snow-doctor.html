                <p>
                    I’ve always been fascinated by how data can tell a story — not just raw numbers, but patterns,
                    trends,
                    and insights that help people make better decisions. Snow Doctor started as a personal project to
                    apply
                    AI and statistical reasoning to a real-world challenge: understanding mountain snow conditions and
                    avalanche risk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project brought together multiple streams of data — weather station readings, forecast models,
                    field observations, and community reports — and processed them into a cohesive picture of the
                    conditions
                    in different ski regions. The goal was not only to gather information, but to interpret it in a way
                    that
                    provides practical guidance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To do this, I combined statistical analysis with large language models. The approach is simple in
                    concept but powerful in execution:
                    raw numerical data feeds into models capable of contextual reasoning, which then generate clear,
                    actionable summaries.
                    This demonstrates my ability to bridge quantitative analysis with AI-driven natural language
                    insights.
                </p>


                <p>
                    While Snow Doctor focuses on mountain conditions, the underlying skills are broadly applicable:
                    designing automated
                    pipelines to collect and clean data, applying statistical models to detect patterns, and using AI to
                    translate those patterns
                    into human-readable insights. It’s an example of how I like to build tools that are both technically
                    robust and genuinely useful to a community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Projects like this reflect my philosophy: combine curiosity, technical expertise, and a focus on
                    impact. I enjoy exploring new
                    technologies, integrating multiple data sources, and finding creative ways to deliver insights that
                    help people make better
                    decisions — whether that’s in the mountains, at work, or anywhere data can guide action.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Snow Doctor is a snapshot of what I do best: leverage AI and statistics, build end-to-end solutions,
                    and create practical applications
                    that people can actually use. It’s fun, it’s challenging, and it’s a perfect example of how I
                    approach technical problems with both rigor
                    and creativity.
